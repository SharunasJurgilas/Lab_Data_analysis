# Lab_data_analysis
This is some of the code I use routinely to analyse data produced during my research.

It contains some useful statistical tools such as common fitting routines, confidence band estimation using the bootstrap, MC sampling to include 
uncertainties in multi-parameter models, and many more.

I am working on documenting and 'cleaning' the code I samshed out during my PhD and I will update this repo over the coming months with most of it.

I also include some Jupyter notebooks, which demostrate how the different modules should be used.
